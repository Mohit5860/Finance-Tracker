# Personal Finance Tracker

A web application to track your transactions, set monthly budgets, and view summaries of your financial activities. This project allows users to add, view, and delete transactions, manage budgets, and view financial summaries like total expenses, top categories, and recent transactions.

## Features

- **Transaction Management**: Add, view, and delete transactions.
- **Budget Management**: Set and manage monthly budgets by category.
- **Transaction Summaries**: View total expenses, top categories, and recent transactions.
- **Category Management**: Predefined categories such as Food, Travel, Bills, etc.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - React
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Date-fns
  - React Context API for state management

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js with Express
  - MongoDB (or PostgreSQL depending on your configuration)

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication (if applicable in your project)
  
- **Deployment**:
  - Vercel for frontend
  - Railway or Heroku for backend (optional)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/personal-finance-tracker.git
cd personal-finance-tracker
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

For the frontend:

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

For the backend (if you have a separate backend):

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in both the frontend and backend directories (if not already present) with the following content:

#### Frontend:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

#### Backend:

```env
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/finance-tracker
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

Make sure to replace the values as appropriate for your setup.

### 4. Running the Application

#### Frontend:

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

#### Backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

By default, the frontend runs on `http://localhost:3000`, and the backend API runs on `http://localhost:5000`.
